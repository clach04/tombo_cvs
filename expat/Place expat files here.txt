Place expat include & libs in this folder.

Expat is distributed by MIT License, in other hand, TOMBO is distributed by GPL.
So, expat's files are not included in this archive.

You will get Expat at http://www.libexpat.org/ 
I built CE version. It will be get at http://homepage2.nifty.com/thirami/indexe.html
